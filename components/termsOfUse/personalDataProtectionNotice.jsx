                    </li>
                    <li>
                    For example, to help you find the car you want close to home, CCAR.my will need to know what kind of car you are looking for and your location. CCAR.my will ask you to provide this information when you perform a search and this information is utilised by CCAR.my to help you find the car you are looking for or as otherwise described in this Notice.

                From time to time, CCAR.my may conduct a survey on its users to measure their satisfaction with the Network and to help CCAR.my learn more about its audience and how they interact with the CCAR Social Network. Third-party research firms often conduct these surveys on our behalf. CCAR.my uses the survey results to help it improve the services that it offers to you.

                You may also find on the Sites, invitations to participate in surveys conducted by advertisers of CCAR.my, whose personal data protection policies are not controlled by CCAR.my. These invitations will usually link to an online survey form that is hosted either by the advertiser conducting the survey or by a third-party research firm working on the advertiser's behalf. When you access an advertiser's survey through the Sites, the use and disclosure of any information you submit will be governed by the advertiser's personal data protection policy (or by the personal data protection policy of the advertiser's research firm), which may differ from CCAR.my’s. If you cannot find the applicable personal data protection policy via a link either from the advertiser's survey invitation or from the online survey form, you should contact the advertiser directly for more information.
